# Optimized Gated Recurrent Unit

OGRU-RNN is optimized version of GRU-RNN that modify the Update Gate [Wang et al](https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-6596/1325/1/012089).

All the code is modified from the originally created by [kaustubhhiware
](https://github.com/kaustubhhiware/LSTM-GRU-from-scratch).

Note : the code is not stable yet
